\section{Cyclotron motion}
Here we want to calculate the cyclotron frquencies and Larmor radii
for electrons and protons in two different systems. 

The cyclotron frequency is simply given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq1:wc}
\wc = \frac{|q|B}{m}.
\end{equation}
Then the Larmor radius is simply $\rL=v_\perp/\wc$, where $v_\perp$ is
the velocity component perpendicular to the magnetic field. We do
however need some expression for $v_\perp$. For that we use the
equipartition theorem from thermodynamics stating that, in thermal
equilibrium, the thermal energy is equally distributed over all
degrees of freedom. For single particle gases this means that 
\begin{equation}
\frac{m}{2} v_i^2 = \frac{1}{3} k_\text{B} T
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
v_i^2 = \frac{2k_\text{B} T}{3m}.
\end{equation}
Now since the perpendicular component of the velocity ``lives'' in two
spacial dimensions, we must have
\begin{equation}
v_\perp^2 = \frac{4k_\text{B} T}{3m}.
\end{equation}
For the Larmor radius, this means
\begin{equation}
\rL = \frac{m}{|q|B}\sqrt{\frac{4k_\text{B} T}{3m}}
=\sqrt{\frac{4m k_\text{B} T}{3q^2B^2}}.
\end{equation}

\section{Uniforn electric and magnetic field}
Here, we have a charged particle initially at rest with the
electromagnetic field
\begin{equation}
\vb*E = E\vu{y}\qc
\vb*B = B\vu{z}
\end{equation}
acting on the particle.

The equation of motion is
\begin{equation}
m\dv{\vb*v}{t} = q\qty(\vb*E + \vb*v\cross\vb*B)
\qc \vb*v(t=0) = \vb*0.
\end{equation}
There is no
