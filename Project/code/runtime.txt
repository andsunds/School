Runtimes are given for runs with 1e7 Monte Carlo steps, and for
when all time steps are written to file ("all") and when just
the averages are saved ("avg").

   1st try: 
Calculating NN and calculating exp( -beta*delta_E ), and
initializing 4 new variables in each call to motecarlo_ising_step.
Runtimes: 18.2 s - "all", 33.4 s - "avg".



  2nd try:
Pre-calculating Boltzmann factors, exp( -beta*delta_E ).
Runtimes: 17.6 s - "all", 32.3 s - "avg".


  3rd try:
Pre-calculating Boltzmann factors, AND all NN's into an array.
Runtimes: 17.4 s - "all", 32.0 s - "avg".
