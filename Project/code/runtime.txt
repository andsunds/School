Runtimes are given for runs with 1e7 Monte Carlo steps, and for
when all time steps are written to file ("all") and when just
the averages are saved ("avg").

   1st try: 
Calculating NN and calculating exp( -beta*delta_E ).
Runtimes: 18.2 s - "all", 33.4 s - "avg".

  2nd try:
Pre-calculating Boltzmann factors, exp( -beta*delta_E ).
Runtimes: 17.6 s - "all", 32.3 s - "avg".

  3rd try:
Pre-calculating Boltzmann factors, AND all NN's into an array.
Runtimes: 17.4 s - "all", 32.0 s - "avg".

  4th try (only affecting avg): 
This time, removed an obsolete calculation of the order
parameter in avg.
Runtimes: ---- s - "all", 17.1 s - "avg".

  5th try:
Only calculating deltaM (instead of the full M) in each loop.
Runtimes: 2.62 s - "all",  2.06 s - "avg".
