Swings and Biorhythms --- Parametrically forced oscillators}

\begin{abstract}\noindent
This report presents two different scenarios, which both can be
modeled as parametrically forced oscillators: pumping a playground
swing, and keeping the circadian rhythm in sync with the
environment. 
Children's swings and biological clocks are very different, but they
present a common problem. Each is a natural oscillator with an
intrinsic free-running rhythm. And each is driven by a forcing
function that works, not by directly pushing the oscillator itself,
but by periodically modifying the parameters of the oscillator.
The swing is modeled as a point-mass pendulum with a time
dependent length. We investigate conditions needed to pump the
swing. Under those conditions we show that the amplitude, to a first
approximation, will increase exponentially.
In the case of the biological clock, the forcing is external light,
which modifies the rate of biochemical reactions such as the synthesis
of messenger RNA. The response of the clock to light is described by a
Phase Response Curve. If it satisfies certain conditions, robust
entrainment will occur.
Mathematically, both of these problems are
united by Floquet Theory: a general analysis of linear differential
equations with periodic parametric forcing. Although Floquet Theory
does not directly give solutions to the differential equations, it
sharply constrains the form these solutions can take. In particular,
it helps to place bounds on the frequencies that will effectively pump
a swing, and it predicts the existence of periodic solutions to the
phase gradient differential equation for the circadian clock.
