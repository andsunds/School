\section{Two characteristics for the Burgers' equation}
%\renewcommand{\thesubsection}{(\roman{subsection})}
In this problem we have two different IC's for Burgers' equation
\begin{equation}
u_t + \frac{1}{2} (u^2)_x = 0\qcomma
-\infty<x<\infty, t>0.
\end{equation}
We already know that the characteristics for the Burgers' equation are
\begin{equation}
\dv{x}{t} = u \quad\text{constant.}
\end{equation}
This equation will be used to determine the slopes of the
characteristics. 
\\[11pt]
\noindent
\textbf{(i) }
The first IC is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1_iIC}
u(x, 0) = 
\begin{cases}
-2\qcomma x<0,\\
-1\qcomma x\ge0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The characteristics and solution at $t=1$ are shown in \figref{fig:1i}.

\begin{figure}

\resizebox{!}{3.6cm}{\input{figures/1i.pdf_t}}
\caption{The characteristics (left) and the solution at $t=1$ (right) 
  resulting from the IC \eqref{eq:1_iiIC}. We get rarefaction since
  the characteristics move away from each other.} 
\label{fig:1i}
\end{figure}

%\\[11pt]
\noindent
\textbf{(ii) }
The second IC is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1_iiIC}
u(x, 0) = 
\begin{cases}
-1\qcomma x<0,\\
-2\qcomma x\ge0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
It is obvious that we will get a shock, so we calculate the known shock
speed for Burgers' equation, which is
\begin{equation}
\dot\xi = \frac{u^++u^-}{2} = -\frac{3}{2}.
\end{equation}
The characteristics and solution at $t=1$ are shown in \figref{fig:1ii}.

\begin{figure}

\resizebox{!}{3.6cm}{\input{figures/1ii.pdf_t}}
\caption{The characteristics (left) and the solution at $t=1$ (right)
  resulting from the IC \eqref{eq:1_iIC}. This time we get a shock
  since the characteristics overlap. } 
\label{fig:1ii}
\end{figure}



\section{Same as before, but different equation}
This time the governing equation is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2_pde}
0 = u_t + \frac{1}{3} (u^3)_x = u_t + u^2u_x\qcomma
-\infty<x<\infty, t>0.
\end{equation}
To get the characteristic, $x(t)$ s.t. $u(x(t), t)$ is const., we use
\begin{equation}
0 = \dv{t} \qty[u(x(t), t)] = u_t + \dv{x}{t}u_x,
\end{equation}
which together with \eqref{eq:2_pde} leads to
\begin{equation}
\dv{x}{t} = u^2.
\end{equation}
We might as well calculate the shock speed while we're at it. Using
the Rankine-Hugoniot condition, we get
\begin{equation}
\dot\xi = \frac{f(u^+) - f(u^-) }{u^+ - u^-} 
= \frac{1}{3}\frac{(u^+)^3 - (u^-)^3}{u^+ - u^-}.
\end{equation}
From here, we just proceed as in the previous problem.
\\[11pt]
\noindent
\textbf{(i) }
The first IC is the same as \eqref{eq:1_iIC}.
The characteristics and solution at $t=1$ are shown in \figref{fig:2i}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\resizebox{!}{3.6cm}{\input{figures/2i.pdf_t}}
\caption{The characteristics (left) and the solution at $t=1$ (right)
  resulting from the IC \eqref{eq:1_iIC}. We get a shock
  since the characteristics overlap, this time the shock speed is
  $\dot\xi=7/3$. } 
\label{fig:2i}
\end{figure}

%\\[11pt]
\noindent
\textbf{(ii) }
The second IC is the same as \eqref{eq:1_iiIC}.
The characteristics and solution at $t=1$ are shown in
\figref{fig:2ii}. It is interesting to note however that since the
propagation speed from \eqref{eq:2_pde} is $u^2$, we would expect the
connecting curve between the upper and lower parts of the former
discontinuity to be parabolic. More precisely it would be a segment of
the curve $x= t\,u^2$.

\section{More modified Burgers}
\renewcommand{\thesubsection}{\arabic{section} (\alph{subsection})}
Here we begin with Burgers' equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3_u}
u_t + \frac{1}{2}(u^2)_x = u_t + uu_x = 0.
\end{equation}
Then we multiply both sides by $u$ and rewrite to get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3_w}
w_t + \frac{2}{3} (w^{3/2}) = 0,
\end{equation}
where $w=u^2$.

\subsection{Show equivalence}
Here we want to show that \eqref{eq:3_w} is equivalent to
\eqref{eq:3_u} given that $u$ and $w$ are \emph{smooth} solutions to
their respective equation and that $w=u^2$.

Given that $u$ is smooth, so must $w=u^2$, so we now substitute this
into \eqref{eq:3_w} and get
\begin{equation}
0 = (u^2)_t + \frac{2}{3} (u^{3})_x = 2u \qty[u_t+uu_x].
\end{equation}
But the expression in brackets are nothing but the LHS of
\eqref{eq:3_u}. This means that
\eqref{eq:3_u}~$\Rightarrow$~\eqref{eq:3_w}, and
\eqref{eq:3_w}~$\Rightarrow$~\eqref{eq:3_u} if $u\neq0$.

To show that $w=u^2$ also requires that their initial conditions must
satisfy $w_0=(u_0)^2$. We can look at the equations for their
characteristics
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\dv{x_u}{t} = u \\
\dv{x_w}{t} = w^{1/2}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
We see that if we put $w=u^2$, both characteristics are going to be
the same, given $u>0$. This means that if we want $w(x(t),t) =
w_0(x(0))$ to equal the square of $u(x(t),t) = u_0(x(0))$, then
obviously $w_0 = (u_0)^2$. Or vice versa, if $w_0 = (u_0)^2$, then
it's clear from the characteristics that $w=u^2$.\footnotemark{}

\footnotetext{We also need the BC's to match according to the square
  relation. But since we don't even know the domain, it is hard to
  specify them any further. }

\subsection{Counter example when solutions not smooth}
If the solutions aren't smooth, then we cannot safely differentiate
and expect us to get the same in the two cases. 

For instance let's use this example:
\begin{equation}
u(x, 0) = u_0(x) =
\begin{cases}
b\qcomma x<0\\
a\qcomma x\ge0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $0<a<b$. And $w(x, 0) = w_0(x) = [u_0(x)]^2$. The
Rankine-Hugoniot shock speeds for the two equations are
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\dot\xi_u = \frac{1}{2}\frac{b^2-a^2}{b-a},\\
\dot\xi_w = \frac{2}{3}\frac{(b^2)^{3/2}-(a^2)^{3/2}}{b-a}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Obviously
\begin{equation}
\frac{\dot\xi_u}{\dot\xi_w}=\frac{3}{4}\frac{b^2-a^2}{b^{3}-a^{3}} 
\neq1
\end{equation}
in general. 
This means that the shock will propagate with different speeds
depending on which equation is used, thus resulting in $w\neq u^2$.
 

\section{A type of advection equation with non-constant coefficients}
This time the equation in question is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4_pde}
u_t - (1+2t)u_x = \varphi(x, t)\qcomma
-\infty<x<\infty,\; t>0.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Equation for the characteristics}
Here we first want to find the equation for the characteristic,
$x(t)$, of \eqref{eq:4_pde}. Given the definition of a characteristic
that ``it is a on which a PDE is reduced to an ODE'', we can let
\begin{equation}
\varphi = \pdv{t}\qty[u(x(t), t)] = u_t + \dv{x}{t}u_x.
\end{equation}
This together with \eqref{eq:4_pde} lets us determine an explicit
equation for the characteristics, namely
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4_char}
\dv{x}{t} = - (1+2t)
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
x(t) = C - \qty(t + \frac{1}{2})^2,
\end{equation}
where $C$ is some constant. In words the characteristics are parabolas,
with their openings in the negative $x$ direction and their vertexes
in the points $(C, -1/2)$. Also since $t>0$, the characteristics are
only the sections above the $x$ axis. 


\subsection{Plot of the characteristics}

To get the specific characteristic that goes through a point
$(\bar{x}, \bar{t})$, we just solve the equation
\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = C - \qty(\bar{t} + \frac{1}{2})^2
\end{equation}
for $C$, and get
\begin{equation}
C_0 = \bar{x} + \qty(\bar{t} + \frac{1}{2})^2.
\end{equation}
In the special case of $(\bar{x}, \bar{t}) = (0, 1)$, we have 
$C_0 = 9/4$. A plot of different characteristics can be found in
\figref{fig:4b}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{4b.eps}
\caption{Different characteristics of \eqref{eq:4_pde}. Especially the
  characteristic $x(t) = 9/4 -(t+1/2)^2$, that goes through the
  point $(\bar{x}, \bar{t}) = (0, 1)$, is marked out as a thicker line.} 
\label{fig:4b}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Solution formula}
To get the solution $u$ at point $(\bar{x}, \bar{t})$, we just use
\begin{equation}
u(\bar{x}, \bar{t}) 
= u_0(x(0)) + \int_{0}^{\bar{t}} \dv{t}[u(x(t), t)]\id{t}
=u_0(C_0+1/4) + \int_0^{\bar{t}} \varphi(x(t), t) \id{t},
\end{equation}
where $u(x, 0) = u_0(x)$, and $x(t) = C_0 - (t-1/2)^2$ with $C_0$
s.t. $x(\bar{t})=\bar{x}$.

In the special case of $(\bar{x}, \bar{t}) = (0, 1)$, we get
\begin{equation}
u(0, 1) = u_0(2) 
+ \int_0^{\bar{t}} \varphi(9/4-(t+1/2)^2, t) \id{t}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Two FD discretization}
Here we have two different discretizations for \eqref{eq:4_pde}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4di}
\frac{U_j^{n+1}-U_j^n}{\Dt} 
- (1+2t_n)\frac{U_j^n-U_{j-1}^n}{\Dx}
-\varphi_j^n = 0
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4dii}
\frac{U_j^{n+1}-U_j^n}{\Dt} 
- (1+2t_n)\frac{U_{j+1}^n-U_{j}^n}{\Dx}
-\varphi_j^n = 0.
\end{equation}
And we want to analyze the stability and consistency of these two
discretizations. 

\subsubsection{Stability}
Based on the shape of the characteristics, we see that the domain of
dependence lies to the \emph{right} of a given point. I.e. we see that
the value of $u(\bar{x}, \bar{t})$ only depends on the values with
$x>\bar{x}$ (and with $t<\bar{t}$). 
Therefore we would expect that \eqref{eq:4di} would be
\emph{unstable}, since it takes its dependence from the \emph{left}
and thus the numerical domain of dependence does not enclose the exact
domain of dependence.
%, where as \eqref{eq:4dii} would be stable.  

\subsubsection{Consistency}
The truncation error for \eqref{eq:4dii} is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\tau_j^n =& 
\frac{1}{\Dt}\qty[u_j^n + \Dt(u_t)_j^n + \order{\Dt^2} - u_j^n]
-(1+2t_n)\frac{1}{\Dx}
\qty[u_j^n + \Dx(u_x)_j^n + \order{\Dx^2} - u_j^n] 
-\varphi_j^n\\
=& (u_t)_j^n -(1+2t_n)(u_x)_j^n -\varphi_j^n +\order{\Dx, \Dt}\\
=& \order{\Dx, \Dt}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Both schemes are very similar; the only difference lies in the second
term, which in the truncation error will look like
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\Dx}
\qty[u_j^n - \qty(u_j^n - \Dx(u_x)_j^n + \order{\Dx^2})]
= (u_x)_j^n + \order{\Dx}.
\end{equation}
So the truncation error will be the same up to $\order{\Dx, \Dt}$.
That is, both of the schemes are consistent to order 1.

\subsubsection{CFL number}
For the scheme \eqref{eq:4dii} we, need the numerical domain to be
shallower than the characteristic going through the point of
interest. From the equation for the characteristics,
\eqref{eq:4_char}, and \figref{fig:4b}, we see that the slope of the
characteristics ($\dv*{t}{x}$) becomes shallower with higher~$t$, i.e.
$t(x)$ is concave, and that the slope only depends on $t$. 

This means that the CFL condition for a numerical scheme must be such
that the numerical slope, $\alpha := \Dt/Dx$, is shallower than the
characteristic at the final time to which the scheme is to be used. 
For a scheme going up to $t=t_N$, that would correspond to
\begin{equation}
\alpha \le \qty|\qty[\dv{x}{t}]_{t=t_N}|^{-1}
= \frac{1}{2t_N +1}.
\end{equation}
In our special case of $(\bar{x}, \bar{t}) = (0, 1)$ this would mean that 
$\alpha\le1/3$, assuming that $t_N=\bar{t}$.


\subsection{Variable time steps}
This time we redo part (d), but with a variable time step.
All analysis, except the CFL, is exactly the same here as before. So
without further ado, we skip directly to the CLF analysis. 

Once again $\alpha_n$ has to be shallower than the slope of the
characteristic, but now we just have to take the current time into
account. So obviously
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4e_easy}
\alpha_n = \frac{\Dt_n}{\Dx} \le \qty|\qty[\dv{x}{t}]_{t=t_n}|^{-1}
= \frac{1}{2t_N +1}.
\end{equation}

It is however possible to get a slightly more aggressive CLF condition,
by exploiting the discreteness of the steps and the concaveness of
$t(x)$. Instead of 
\eqref{eq:4e_easy}, we can write
\begin{equation}
\alpha_n = \frac{\Dt_n}{\Dx} 
\le \frac{\Dt_n}{\qty|\oldint_{t_{n-1}}^{t_{n}}\dv{x}{t}\id{t}|}.
\end{equation}
The integral in question is straight forward to solve
\begin{equation}
\qty|\int_{t_{n-1}}^{t_{n}}\dv{x}{t}\id{t}| 
%= \qty(t_{n+1}^2+t_{n+1}) - \qty(t_{n}^2 + t_{n})
= \qty[t_{n}^2 + t_{n}] -\qty[ \qty(t_{n}-\Dt_n)^2+(t_{n}-\Dt_n) ]
= \Dt_n\Big[2t_n + 1 - \Dt_n\Big].
\end{equation}
This means that 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_n = \frac{\Dt_n}{\Dx} 
\le \frac{1}{2t_n + 1 - \Dt_n},
\end{equation}
which is slightly more aggressive than \eqref{eq:4e_easy}, since
$\Dt_n>0$. This is however, hardly worth pursuing any further.
