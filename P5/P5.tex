\section{Different frames of reference}
In the rest frame of the tritium nucleus the D-T fusion reaction has
its maximum cross section when the incoming deuterium nucleus has an
temperature of around $\TD=\unit[100]{keV}$.
(Note that $\ED\ll\mT c^2\approx\unit[2]{GeV}$ which means that we do
not have to take relativity into account.) That would correspond to an
velocity $\vD$ given by ($\kB=1$)
\begin{equation}
\ED=\frac{1}{2}\mD\vD^2=\alpha^{-1}\TD.
\end{equation}
The constant $\alpha$ is the constant you choose for your
normalization of tempereature, it dosen't matter in the end.

If we instead change to the rest frame of the deuterium nucleus the
tritium nucleus would be rushing in at the same speed $\vT=\vD$, which
would correspond to a temperature of
\begin{equation}
\TD = \alpha \ET = \frac{1}{2}\mT\vT^2
= \frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{3}{2}\mD)\vD^2 
= \frac{2}{3}\alpha\ED = \frac{2}{3}\TD= \unit[150]{keV}.
\end{equation}
Here we have used the fact that the tritum nucleus basically has
three times the mass of a proton ($\mT=3\mH$) and deuterium is twice
the proton mass ($\mD=2\mH$).

In the lab fram of reference, where the tempereatures are equal
($\TD'=\TT'$), we instead get the equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq1:eqT}
\cancel{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\mD\vD'^2=\cancel{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\mT\vT'^2,
\end{equation}
together with the transformed velocities
\begin{equation}
\vD'=\vD-v_0\qc\quad\vT'=0+v_0.
\end{equation}
With this we can write \eqref{eq1:eqT} as
\begin{equation}
0=\mT v_0^2-\mD(\vD-v_0)^2
=(\mT-\mD)v_0^2 +2\mD\vD v_0 - \mD\vD^2
\end{equation}
which has the solutions
\begin{equation}
v_0=\frac{-\mD\vD\pm
\vD\sqrt{\mD^2+(\mT{-}\mD)\mD}
}{\mT-\mD}
%=\qty(\frac{-2\mH\pm\sqrt{4\mH^2+2\mH^2}}{1\mH})\vD
=\qty(-2\pm\sqrt{6})\vD.
\end{equation}
We are only interested in the plus sign solution, since we want to
transform into a frame of reference where the two nucleons are heading
into each other ``head on''. This means that the tempereature has to
be
\begin{equation}
\TD'=\TT'=\frac{\alpha}{2}\mT v_0^2
=\frac{\alpha}{2}\qty(\frac{3}{2}\mD)\qty(\sqrt6-2)^2\vD^2
=\frac{3}{2}\qty(\sqrt6-2)^2 \TD
\approx\unit[30]{keV}.
\end{equation}
